        <p>Utah is a state in the western United States. It is bordered by Colorado
            to the east, Wyoming to the northeast, Idaho to the north, Arizona to
            the south, and Nevada to the west. It also touches a corner of New
            Mexico in the southeast. The state is a center of transportation,
            education, information technology, and research, and a major tourist
            destination for outdoor recreation. Salt Lake City, the state capital
            and largest city, is home to the headquarters of The Church of Jesus
            Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).</p>
